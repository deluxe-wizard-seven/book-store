## Project Version
1.0.0

## Built With
* `MongoDB`
* `Express.js`
* `Node.js` (version=20.4.0)
* `React.js` (version=18.2.0)
* `npm` (version=9.8.0)

## Getting Started

In order to run this application the following steps must be performed :-

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure your system has the `npm` package manager of `version >= 9.8.0`.

### 2. Dependencies Resolving
In the terminal, navigate to the `frontend` and `backend` directory respectively, then run the following command ```npm install``` or ```npm i```, in each of the directories. In each of the directories, `package.json` file is present which contains the data required to build the project, it contains the meta data, dependencies, requirements and such stuffs required to build the project. The command ```npm install``` or ```npm i``` installs the dependencies required to build the project.

### 3. Running the services
In the terminal, navigate to the `frontend` and execute the command ```npm run build``` this will start the frontend service at the port `5173` and then go the `backend` directory and run the following command ```npm run start``` to get the backend service started on port `5500`. Both the services will run in the `localhost` of the system. Then open `http://localhost:5173/` or `http://127.0.0.1:5713/` in your browser to get started.

### 4. Terminating the services
In the terminal, navigate to the tab/window where currently the commands are executing, there click `CTRL-C` to terminate the current process, this will stop the server. This has to be done in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
